**MY SECOND ALX SYSTEM ENGINEERING DEVOPS PROJECT**

In this project I learn how to write executable scripts using shell permissions

1. **A script that swtiches the current user:**
   To change the current user you can use the **su** command in the terminal.
   The 0-iam_betty file in the repository takes this command and turns it into
   an executable script.
