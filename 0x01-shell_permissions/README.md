**MY SECOND ALX SYSTEM ENGINEERING DEVOPS PROJECT**

In this project I learn how to write executable scripts using shell permissions

1. **A script that swtiches the current user:**
   To change the current user you can use the **su** command in the terminal.
   The 0-iam_betty file in the repository takes this command and turns it into
   an executable script.

2. **A script that prints the effective username of the current user:**
   To print the username of the user, use the **whoami** command in the terminal.
   The 1-who_am_i file in the repository takes this command and turns it into an
   executable script.

3. **A script that prints all groups the current user is part of:**
   To print the groups the user is part of use the **groups** command in the
   terminal.
   The 2-groups file in the repository takes this command and turns it into an
   executable script.

4. **A script that changes the owner of a file:**
   To change the owner of the file use the **chown** command in the terminal
   The 3-new_owner file in the repository takes this command and turns it into an
   executable script.

5. **A script that create an empty file named hello:**
   To create an empty file, use the **touch** command in the terminal.
   The 4-empty file in the repository takes this command and turns it into an
   executable script.
