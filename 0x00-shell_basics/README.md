**MY FIRST ALX SYSTEM ENGINEERING DEVOPS PROJECT**

In this project I learn how to write executable scripts using shell commands.

1.**A script that prints the absolute path name:**
   To print the absolute path name in the terminal, use the **pwd** command
   in the terminal
   The 0-current_working_directory file in the repositorytakes this command
   and turns it into an executable script.

2. **A script that lists contents of the current directory:**
   To list the contents of the current working directory, use the **ls** command
   in the terminal.
   The 1-listit file in this repository takes this command and turns
   it into an executable script.

3.**A script that takes the user back to the home directory:**
   To go back to the home directory from the current working directory, use the **cd**
   command in the terminal.
   The 2-bring_me_home file in this repository takes this command and turns in into
   an executable script.

4. **A script that displays the contents of a directory in long format:**
   To display the contents of a directory in long format, use the *ls -l** command in the
   terminal.
   The 3-listfiles file in the repository takes this command and turns it into an executable
   script.
