**My first ALX System Engineering Devops Project**

In this project I learn how to write executable scripts for the following shell commands:

1. A script that prints the absolute path name:
   To print the absolute path name in the terminal, use the **pwd** command
   in the terminal
   The 0-current_working_directory file in the repositorytakes this command
   and turns it into an executable script.

2. A script that lists contents of the current directory:
   To list the contents of the current working directory, use the **ls** command
   in the terminal.
   The 1-listit file in this repository takes this command and turns
   it into an executable script.

3. A script that takes the user back to the home directory:
   To go back to the home directory from the current working directory, use the **cd**
   command in the terminal.
   The 2-bring_me_home file in this repository takes this command and turns in into
   an executable script.
