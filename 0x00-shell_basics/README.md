**My first ALX System Engineering Devops Project**

In this project I learn how to write executable scripts for the following shell commands:

1. A script that prints the absolute path name:
   To print the absolute path name in the terminal, use the *pwd* command.
   The 0-current_working_directory file in the repository is a script
   that takes this command and turns it into an executable script.
