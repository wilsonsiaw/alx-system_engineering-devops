**MY THIRD ALX SYSTEM ENGINEERING DEVOPS PROJECT**

In this project I write Unix Shell scripts that perform
Input/Output redirections. I also use Unix commands to
create filters.

1. **A script that prints to the standard output.:**
   To print "Hello, World" to the standard output, use the **echo**
   command in the terminal.
   The 0-hello_world file in the repository takes this command and
   turns it into an executable script.

2. **A script that displays a confused smiley:**

3. **A script that prints /etc/passwd:**
   To print display the contents of any directory, use the **less**
   command in the terminal.
   The 2-hellofile in the repository takes this command and turns it
   into an executable script.

4. **A script that prints the content of /etc/passwd and /etc/hosts:**
   To print the contents of any directory such as the two mentioned above
   use the **less** command in the terminal. Note that the two directories
   must be separated by some whitespace.
   The 3-twofiles in the repository takes this command and turns it into an
   executable script.

5. **A script that displays the last 10 lines of /etc/passwd:**
   To display the last 10 lines of any file or directory, use the
   **tail** command in the terminal.
   The 4-lastlines file in the repository takes this command and turns it into
   an executable script.

6. **A script that displays the first 10 lines of /etc/passwd:**
   To display the first 10 lines of any file or directory, use the **tail**
   command in the terminal with any arguments.
   The 5-firstlines file in the repository takes this command and turns it into
   an executable script.

7. **A script that displays the third line of a file:**
   To display the third line of a file use a combination of the **head** and **tail**
   commands in the terminal.
   The 6-third_line file in the repository takes this command and turns into an
   executable script.

8. **A script that writes into a file using a shell command:**
   To write into a file using a shell command use the >
   redirection operator in the terminal.
   The 8-cwd_state file in the repository takes this operator and a shell command
   and turns it into an executable script.
