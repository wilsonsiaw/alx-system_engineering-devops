**MY THIRD ALX SYSTEM ENGINEERING DEVOPS PORJECT**

In this project I write Unix Shell scripts that perform
Input/Output redirections. I also use Unix commands to
create filters.

1. **A script that prints to the standard output.:**
   To print "Hello, World" to the standard output, use the **echo**
   command in the terminal.
   The 0-hello_world file in the repository takes this command and
   turns it into an executable script.
