**MY THIRD ALX SYSTEM ENGINEERING DEVOPS PORJECT**

In this project I write Unix Shell scripts that perform
Input/Output redirections. I also use Unix commands to
create filters.

1. **A script that prints to the standard output.:**
   To print "Hello, World" to the standard output, use the **echo**
   command in the terminal.
   The 0-hello_world file in the repository takes this command and
   turns it into an executable script.

2. **A script that displays a confused smiley:**

3. **A script that prints /etc/passwd:**
   To print display the contents of any directory, use the **less**
   command in the terminal.
   The 2-hellofile in the repository takes this command and turns it
   into an executable script.
