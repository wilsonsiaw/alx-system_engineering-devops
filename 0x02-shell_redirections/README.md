**MY THIRD ALX SYSTEM ENGINEERING DEVOPS PORJECT**

In this project I write Unix Shell scripts that perform
Input/Output redirections. I also use Unix commands to
create filters.

1. **A script that prints to the standard output.:**
   To print "Hello, World" to the standard output, use the **echo**
   command in the terminal.
   The 0-hello_world file in the repository takes this command and
   turns it into an executable script.

2. **A script that displays a confused smiley:**

3. **A script that prints /etc/passwd:**
   To print display the contents of any directory, use the **less**
   command in the terminal.
   The 2-hellofile in the repository takes this command and turns it
   into an executable script.

4. **A script that prints the content of /etc/passwd and /etc/hosts:**
   To print the contents of any directory such as the two mentioned above
   use the **less** command in the terminal. Note that the two directories
   must be separated by some whitespace.
   The 3-twofiles in the repository takes this command and turns it into an
   executable script.

5. **A script that displays the last 10 lines of /etc/passwd:**
   To display the last 10 lines of any file or directory, use the
   **tail** command in the terminal.
   The 4-lastlines file in the repository takes this command and turns it into
   an executable script.
