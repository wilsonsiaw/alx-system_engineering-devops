**MY FOURTH ALX SYSTEM ENGINEERING DEVOPS PROJECT**

In this project I write scripts using shell variables and expnasions.

0. **A script that creates an alias:**
   To create an alias use the **alias** command in the terminal. The 0-alias
   file file in the repository takes this command and turns it into an
   executable script.
