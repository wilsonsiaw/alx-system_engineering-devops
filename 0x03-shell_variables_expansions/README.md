**MY FOURTH ALX SYSTEM ENGINEERING DEVOPS PROJECT**

In this project I write scripts using shell variables and expnasions.

0. **A script that creates an alias:**
   To create an alias use the **alias** command in the terminal. The 0-alias
   file file in the repository takes this command and turns it into an
   executable script.

1. **A script that prints "hello user" with the current Linux user:**
   To print hello with the current linux user, use parameter expansion.
   Use the **echo** command with the **$** in the terminal.
   The 1-hello_you file in the repository takes this command and turns in
   into an executable script.
